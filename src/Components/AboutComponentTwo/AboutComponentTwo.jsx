                                I am a dedicated and results-driven HR/TA professional with a passion for talent management, graduate recruitment, 
                                graduate programme development and branding strategist. I began my HR career in a start-up environment, 
                                where I had the opportunity to build HR processes from the ground up. With no existing HR structure in place, 
                                I developed and implemented essential systems, including an HR service request portal, requisition procedures, 
                                and recruitment, induction, and onboarding processes.
                            </p>
                            <p className="about-component-description mt-4 text-center text-sm-center text-md-start">
                                Shortly thereafter, my focus shifted towards graduate recruitment and the development of graduate programmes. I took ownership of all aspects of the graduate lifecycle—from induction to programme completion—ensuring a seamless and engaging experience for graduates.

                                My work in graduate recruitment has involved building and nurturing partnerships with universities, bootcamps, and student-led associations, fostering relationships that enable access to top talent. Through these partnerships, I also became a brand advocate, representing my employer both online via social media and webinars, and in person at events. In doing so, I honed my skills in social media, public speaking, and presentation, while consistently championing the brand I represented.

                                I hold an undergraduate degree in Psychology as well as certifications in Artificial Intelligence and Financial Literacy from the University of Johannesburg. 
                                Additionally, I have a certification in Human Resource Management from the University of Cape Town and I am currently pursuing my Honours in Counselling Psychology, part-time, 
                                through the University of South Africa. I believe my qualifications demonstrate my commitment to continuous professional development and staying abreast of industry best practices. 
                                My approach to HR is rooted in fostering a positive workplace culture, enhancing employee experiences, and aligning HR initiatives with organizational goals.
